# fbs tutorial
Tutorial for creating cross-platform desktop applications with
[fbs](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs).

## Getting Started
This tutorial is meant for Windows, Mac and Ubuntu. You need Python 3.5.
(Higher versions may work as well, but are not officially supported.)

Clone this repository and `cd` into it:

    git clone https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs-tutorial
    cd fbs-tutorial

Create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    # On Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    call venv\scripts\activate.bat

Install the required libraries (most notably, `fbs` and `PyQt5`):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the sample app:

    python -m fbs run

This shows a (admittedly not very exciting) window:

To compile the app to a standalone executable:

    python -m fbs freeze

This produces the folder `target/App.app`. You can copy this folder to any other
computer (with the same OS as yours) and run your app there! Isn't that awesome?

## The source code
The source code for the above app is in
[`src/main/python`](src/main/python/sample). It contains a
[`main.py` script](src/main/python/sample/main.py), which serves as the entry
point for the application:

```python
from sample.application_context import AppContext

import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    appctxt = AppContext()
    exit_code = appctxt.run()
    sys.exit(exit_code)
```

The script instantiates and then runs an _application context_. This is defined
in [`application_context.py`](src/main/python/sample/application_context.py):

```python
from fbs_runtime.application_context import ApplicationContext, \
    cached_property
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow

class AppContext(ApplicationContext):
    def run(self):
        self.main_window.show()
        return self.app.exec_()
    @cached_property
    def main_window(self):
        result = QMainWindow()
        result.setWindowTitle('Hello World!')
        result.resize(250, 150)
        return result
```

Your apps should follow the same structure:

 * Create a subclass of `fbs_runtime.application_context.ApplicationContext`.
 * Define a `run()` method that ends with `return self.app.exec_()`.
 * Use `@cached_property` to define the objects of your app.
 * In your `main` script, instantiate the application context, invoke its
   `run()` method and pass the return value to `sys.exit(...)`.

This  may seem complicated at first. But it has several advantages: First, it
lets `fbs` define useful default behaviour (such as setting the
[app icon](src/main/icons) or letting you access resource files bundled with
your app). Also, as your application becomes more complex, you will find that
an application context is extremely useful for "wiring together" the various
Python objects that make up your app. The next section demonstrates both of
these advantages.

## A more complicated example
Take a look at
[`application_context_2.py`](src/main/python/sample/application_context_2.py).
It defines a new `@cached_property`:

```python
class AppContext(ApplicationContext):
    ...
    @cached_property
    def image(self):
        return QPixmap(self.get_resource('success.jpg'))
```

A `@cached_property` is simply a Python `@property` whose value is cached.
Here's how it is used:

```python
class AppContext(ApplicationContext):
    ...
    @cached_property
    def main_window(self):
        ...
        image_container.setPixmap(self.image)
```

The first time `self.image` is accessed, the `return QPixmap(...)` code from 
above is executed. After that, the value is cached and returned without
executing the code again.

`@cached_property` is extremely useful for instantiating and connecting the
Python objects that make up your application. For each component, define a
`@cached_property`. If it requires other objects, simply access them as
properties, like `self.image` above. The fact that all parts of your application
live in one place (the application context) makes it extremely easy to manage
them and see what is used where.

To see the new example in action, change the line

```python
from sample.application_context import AppContext
```

in your copy of [`main.py`](src/main/python/sample/main.py) to

```python
from sample.application_context_2 import AppContext
```

Then, run `python -m fbs run` again. You will be rewarded ;-)

### Resources
Another feature of our new example was the call
`self.get_resource('success.jpg')`. It loads an image that lives in the folder
[`src/main/resources`](src/main/resources/base).
But what if the user is running the compiled form of your app? In that case,
there is no `src/...`, because the directory structure is completely different.

The answer is that `get_resource(...)` is clever enough to determine whether it
is running from source, or from the compiled form of your app. To ensure that
the image is in fact distributed alongside your application, `fbs` copies all
files from `src/main/resources` into the `target/App.app` folder. So, if you
have data files that you want to include (such as images, `.qss` style sheets -
Qt's equivalent of `.css` files - etc.) place them in `src/main/resources`.

### Different OSs
Often, you will want to use different versions of a resource file depending on
the operating system. A typical example of this are `.qss` files where you
modify your app's style to match the current OS.

The solution for this is that `get_resource(...)` first looks for a
platform-specific version of the given file. Depending on the current OS, it
searches the following locations:

 * `src/main/resources/windows`
 * `src/main/resources/mac`
 * `src/main/resources/linux`

If it can't find the file in any of these folders, it falls back to
`src/main/resources/base`.

## Up next...
As of Dec 20, 2017, this tutorial is a work in progress. Still to come:

 * Creating an installer for your app
 * Codesigning so your users don't get ugly "app is untrusted" messages
 * Automatic updates
